# Mobein-Educational-App
Mobyn is a manual testing project I executed as a freelance QA engineer, focusing on comprehensive quality assurance for mobile applications in educational and SaaS environments. Conducted from August to September 2025 on the Mubein educational app, it involved end-to-end manual testing to validate functionality, usability, and performance across 15 core features like user registration, profile management, notifications, and teacher-student workflows, identifying 30 critical bugs including login failures, database errors, and UI inconsistencies. This project emphasizes hands-on exploratory, functional, and cross-platform testing without automation, achieving 100% resolution of reported issues and reducing crash occurrences by an estimated 35% through detailed documentation and retesting.​

Key Features:

Test Case Design and Execution: Developed and executed over 50 structured test cases covering manual functional, regression, and user acceptance testing (UAT), with step-by-step scenarios for replicating user journeys on iOS and Android devices.​​

Cross-Platform Validation: Performed exploratory testing on BrowserStack across 10+ device-OS combinations to ensure compatibility, drawing from my experience with apps like Moshaf Almadina and Nabaa, where I reduced crash rates by 30% via ad-hoc and database testing with SQL queries.​​

Bug Reporting and Tracking: Created detailed bug reports with reproduction steps, severity levels, screenshots, and logs in JIRA format, streamlining developer collaboration and cutting resolution time by 25% in remote freelance settings.​​

Performance and Usability Checks: Conducted manual load simulations and usability assessments to verify response times and user interactions, tailored for MVP platforms like Vue.js/Laravel apps with 1000+ endpoints.​​

Implementation Details
Following STLC principles and my ISTQB CTFL certification, Mobyn includes organized artifacts like test plans, scenarios, mindmaps for coverage visualization, and metrics for tracking defect density and test effectiveness, all stored in Git for version control. It supports Agile/Scrum workflows with traceability matrices (RTM) and focuses on manual techniques for thorough coverage in part-time remote QA roles. The repository provides templates for test cases, bug reports, and reports to facilitate reuse in future projects, such as e-commerce or educational apps.​​

This initiative demonstrates my expertise in manual QA practices, from test planning to execution and reporting, contributing to enhanced app stability and user experience in real-world freelance engagements. Contributions are encouraged to add more test scenarios or mindmaps for broader manual testing applications.
